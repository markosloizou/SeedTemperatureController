# Seed Temperature Controller

Some seeds require a relatively high temperature to germinate, such as 28 
degrees Celsius.  This project controls the soil temperature as well as the
heating plate temperature and a further 'internal' to make sure that the 
soil temperature is within a range suitable for germination while making sure that
the plate and internal temperatures are low enough to avoid a fire hazard. 

The heating is controlled by a relay and 2 current sources depending on thermal
losses and required speed.
